The purpose of this project is to create a static comp from an original example with using only basic HTML and CSS. We were not allowed to use flexbox or grid for aid. Once the original static comp had complete HTML and CSS, the objective became to create a second static comp while using the original HTML. Once finished, the objective was to add Javascript, media queries, and extentions to make the page more dynamic.

This is the first composition which we had to reproduce

These final two images are the second composition that I had created.

This is the lower half of the site. I have fixed the footer to the floor, so that it scrolls with the user, but this blocks the view of the lower content on a standard Google Chrome website.

The top links in the nav bar all have tooltips attached to them. The input form in the banner replaces the heading to say, "A site about Some Dogs", to "A site about (whatever the user input". Finally, the paragraphs in the main content disappear and reappear when the user clicks on them. 

Some challenges I encountered when doing this project were writing and rewriting the HTML to optimize the content for both sites, timing my commits properly so that each commit was about a specific section of the code, refactoring information to make sure each line of code was purposeful, and finally, media queries and cross-browser compatibility. I have a media query within my CSS and it responds in the 'Responsive' section of the developer tools, but it does not work fully within the Chrome browser. BUT! When I go to a Safari browser, the content is not formatted properly, yet the media query works well. 

Questions I have as I exit the project are, is alphabetizing CSS industry standard? How do I optimize my media queries? Finally, how do I best provide optimization for multiple browsers?

Thank you
