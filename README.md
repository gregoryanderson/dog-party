The purpose of this project is to create a static comp from an original example with using only basic HTML and CSS. We were not allowed to use flexbox or grid for aid. Once the original static comp had complete HTML and CSS, the objective became to create a second static comp while using the original HTML. Once finished, the objective was to add Javascript, media queries, and extentions to make the page more dynamic.

This is the first composition which we had to reproduce

The top links all have tooltips attached to them. The input form in the banner replaces the heading to say, "A site about Some Dogs", to "A site about (whatever the user input". Finally, the paragraphs in the main content disappear and reappear when the user clicks on them.
